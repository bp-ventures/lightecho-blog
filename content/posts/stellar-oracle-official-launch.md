BPV announces the introduction of the LightEcho Oracle, a novel oracle service on Stellar’s Soroban platform, aimed at providing pricing data for emerging markets and managing XLM volatility. This addresses the needs of underrepresented and developing markets whilst allowing projects the possibility of creating new types of applications serving or operating on these markets such as FX Options.

The LightEcho Oracle is free and does not rely on external tokens. Choosing Stellar’s Soroban helps developers and companies more readily create inclusive and viable financial solutions, our Oracle is here to help you do exactly that.

At launch, the LightEcho Oracle will support a variety of currency pairs against XLM, including XLMVOL30d – a measure of volatility over the past 30 days crucial for Black-Scholes option pricing models - and the following pairs, USD, EUR, NGN, KES, EUR, USD, INR, ARS, and BRL. This selection is set to expand with additional USD pairs based on community demand within the next 30 days. The Oracle updates every 10 minutes, ensuring timely and accurate data for users and uses 18 decimal points for accuracy. And is also the first oracle of its kind to support event triggers

LightEcho also pledges a commitment to the affordability of our oracle; by polling all last price oracle contract calls and refunding XLM used to call the oracle, BPV is making this critical service free for users! This approach not only encourages wider adoption but also supports the development of sophisticated DeFi applications, including lending platforms, automated market makers (AMMs), and derivatives markets.

The production contract address for LightEcho Oracle is:
